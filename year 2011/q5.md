> Using either pseudocode or Java, show how a **bubble sort** algorithm can be used to sort the array of integers. Your answer should show the state of the array as the search proceeds.

```Java
// pseudo Java like code

// It's naive example (sorted array will be sorted again)
void bubbleSort(A[]){

    if( A.length < 2 ){ return }                    // empty or single value, no need to sort

    for( last = A.length; last != 0; last-- ){      // last element to compare to.
        swaped = false

        for( i = 1; i < last; i++ ){                // iterate untill reach last element
            // if previouse element is bigger then current element, swap them
            if( A[i -1] > A[i] ){
                swap(A, i)
                swaped = true
            }
        }
        if( NOT swaped ){
            return                                  // elements already in order, done
        }
    }
}

```

<br>[5, 8, 2, 11, 23, 6] - original ArrayList
<br>_**loop 1**_
<br>[**5, 8**, 2, 11, 23, 6] - ok
<br>[5, **8, 2**, 11, 23, 6] - swap - [5, **2, 8**, 11, 23, 6]
<br>[5, 2, **8, 11**, 23, 6] - ok
<br>[5, 2, 8, **11, 23**, 6] - ok
<br>[5, 2, 8, 11, **23, 6**] - swap - [5, 2, 8, 11, **6, 23**]
<br>_**loop 2**_
<br>[**5, 2**, 8, 11, 6, (_**23**_)] - swap - [**2, 5**, 8, 11, 6, (_**23**_)]
<br>[2, **5, 8**, 11, 6, (_**23**_)] - ok
<br>[2, 5, **8, 11**, 6, (_**23**_)] - ok
<br>[2, 5, 8, **11, 6**, (_**23**_)] - swap - [2, 5, 8, **6, 11**, (_**23**_)]
<br>_**loop 3**_
<br>[**2, 5**, 8, 6, (_**11, 23**_)] - ok
<br>[2, **5, 8**, 6, (_**11, 23**_)] - ok
<br>[2, 5, **8, 6**, (_**11, 23**_)] - swap - [2, 5, **6, 8**, (_**11, 23**_)]
<br>_**loop 4**_
<br>[**2, 5**, 6, (_**8, 11, 23**_)] - ok
<br>[2, **5, 6**, (_**8, 11, 23**_)] - ok
<br> _**done**_ - nothing was swaped
<br>[(_**2, 5, 6, 8, 11, 23**_)]

> Explain the running time of the bubble sort algorithm and identify the parts of the algorithm that contribute most to the time complexity.

Bubble sort **running time** O(n^2), because here are two nested loops and they loop n times each(not exactly, but it's insignificant for Big-O notation).

> Briefly describe how the `java.util.Collections` utility class can be used to sort generic collections and lists.

`java.util.Collections` has two sorting methods. One of them `sort(List)` use `interface Comparable` to sort elements. Another one `sort(List, Comparator)` use `interface Comparator` (passed as one of parameters).
