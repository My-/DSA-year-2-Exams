## Question 4
> The following is a class definition for a Person type, where the hashCode() method has been over-ridden by a delegate call to the hash code returned by the instance variable “name”:

```java
public class Person{
    private String ppsn;
    private String firstName;

    public Person(String ppsn, String firstName){
        this.ppsn = ppsn;
        this. firstName = firstName;
    }

    public int hashCode(){
        return firstName.hashCode();
    }
}
```

**(Q4.a)** 2 Marks
> Show how a **_HashMap_** can be instantiated in Java, that is a parameterized map of strings of first names to instances of Person.


```Java
    Map<String, Person> pplMap = new HashMap();
```

**(Q4.b)** 10 Marks
> Explain the consequences, in terms of the **_chain implementation of hash-map_**, of adding a new Person object to the map with the same first-name as an existing map entry. Include a diagram in your answer.

Then we try to entry same key second time in to` HashMap` we owerwrite existing value with a new one. To keep all values we need some collection to hold same key values. Below example use `List` of `Person`'s to store all persons with the same key.

```Java
    String name = "some_name";                  // name we want to add to map (is a map key).
    Map<String, List<Person>> ppl = new HashMap(); // map we want to add new person

    // Chain implementation
    if( ppl.containsKey( name ) ){              // if name exist in a map ...
        ppl.get( name )                         // ... get list from map with key == name ...
            .add( new Person("pps", name) );    // ... and add new person to end of that list.
    }else{                                      // ELSE (unique key)
        List<person> list = new ArrayList();    // Create new list ...
        list.add( new Person("pps", name) );    // ... add new person ...
        ppl.put(name, list);                    // ... put that list in map using given name as a key.
    }

```

**(Q4.c)** 7 Marks
> Describe how the `hashCode()` method can be implemented in the `Person` class to resolve the problem described in (b) and explain how collisions are handled in `HashTable` and `HashMap`.

To resolve collision problem we could include `ppsn` class variable inside the `hashCode()`. Posible solution could be:
```Java
public int hashCode(){
    return (firstName +ppsn).hashCode();
}
```

If collision occurs in `HashMap` old key maching value is replased by the new one. I would assume same thing happens in `HashTable` as well.

**(Q4.d)** 3+3 Marks
> Briefly, explain the following terms, as they apply to hash tables:
- **Open Addressing** - Is then collision is handled by not creting collections but by changing collision key hashCode [More here.](http://www.algolist.net/Data_structures/Hash_table/Open_addressing)
- **Load Factor** - Is factor of how much collection can be filed before increasing it's capacity.
